### Description
A website that leads the user through a quiz assessing their strengths via Howard Gardnerâ€™s Theory of Multiple Intelligences. The app provides education, automated scoring, and a color coded graph of the results. The app is actively being used in field in Seattle Public Schools and is under continued development by team member Adrienne Easton for improved user experience and accessibility.

### User Stories
* As a developer I want to create an application that teachers, counselors, psychologists, and anyone else interested in learning can have guidance for individual strengths and weaknesses.
* As a developer I want to write interesting yet DRY code that will create an easy to use application.  
* As a developer I want to create a program that has strong accessibility, such as to people who don't read or are visually impaired. 
* As a developer I want to provide my user with context for why this information is important and useful as well as history.
* As a user I want a tool that can assess what a client/students' relative strengths and weaknesses are.
* As a user I want survey results that can clearly be understandable to a wide audience, through verbally based results, tables, and charts. 
* As test taker, I want the interface and questions to be easy to use and understand. 
* As a test taker, I want to to have a sense of how long the test is and how much further I have to go. 
* As a test taker I want have access both before and after the test to clear descriptions of the different intelligence types and how this information can be used.
