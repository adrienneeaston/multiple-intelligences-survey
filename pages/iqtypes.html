  <h2>7 Intelligence Types</h2>
  <p>blurb about the importance of different types of intelligence and how they are simply parts of a whole and that whole is more than the sum of its parts.</p>  

  <h3>Linguistic intelligence</h3>
  <p>Linguistic intelligence involves sensitivity to spoken and written language, the ability to learn languages, and the capacity to use language to accomplish certain goals. This intelligence includes the ability to effectively use language to express oneself rhetorically or poetically; and language as a means to remember information. Writers, poets, lawyers and speakers are among those that Howard Gardner sees as having high linguistic intelligence.</p>

  <h3>Logical-mathematical intelligence</h3>
  <p>Logical-mathematical intelligence consists of the capacity to analyze problems logically, carry out mathematical operations, and investigate issues scientifically. In Howard Gardner's words, it entails the ability to detect patterns, reason deductively and think logically. This intelligence is most often associated with scientific and mathematical thinking.</p>

  <h3>Musical intelligence</h3>
  <p>Musical intelligence involves skill in the performance, composition, and appreciation of musical patterns. It encompasses the capacity to recognize and compose musical pitches, tones, and rhythms. According to Howard Gardner musical intelligence runs in an almost structural parallel to linguistic intelligence.</p>

  <h3>Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence</h3>
  <p>Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence entails the potential of using one's whole body or parts of the body to solve problems. It is the ability to use mental abilities to coordinate bodily movements. Howard Gardner sees mental and physical activity as related.</p>

  <h3>Spatial intelligence</h3>
  <p>Spatial intelligence involves the potential to recognize and use the patterns of wide space and more confined areas.</p>

  <h3>Interpersonal intelligence</h3>
  <p>Interpersonal intelligence is concerned with the capacity to understand the intentions, motivations and desires of other people. It allows people to work effectively with others. Educators, salespeople, religious and political leaders and counselors all need a welldeveloped interpersonal intelligence.</p>

  <h3>Intrapersonal intelligence</h3>
  <p>Intrapersonal intelligence entails the capacity to understand oneself, to appreciate one's feelings, fears and motivations. In Howard Gardner's view it involves having an effective working model of ourselves, and to be able to use such information to regulate our lives</p>
