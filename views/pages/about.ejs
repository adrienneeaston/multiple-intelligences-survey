      <h3>Aileen Murphy</h3>
      <p>Aileen, like her colleagues, is a software developer based out of Seattle. This girl has lived around the globe and done everything from selling scuba gear, to teaching 4th grade science, to briefing generals--yes, like, military decision makers. These ragtag experiences have shaped beliefs in her heart but two of the strongest are: there's no place like home and leave it better than you found it. She has deep convicitons about education and our natural environment, since she plans to leave this place to her kids. The influence of these convictions and her belief in the vision of her friend, Adrienne, drew her to join this team.</p>
