Descriptions:

Linguistic intelligence involves sensitivity to spoken and written language, the ability to
learn languages, and the capacity to use language to accomplish certain goals. This
intelligence includes the ability to effectively use language to express oneself rhetorically
or poetically; and language as a means to remember information. Writers, poets, lawyers
and speakers are among those that Howard Gardner sees as having high linguistic
intelligence. Potential careers: writer, editor, attorney, politician, public speaker.

Logical-mathematical intelligence consists of the capacity to analyze problems
logically, carry out mathematical operations, and investigate issues scientifically. In
Howard Gardner's words, it entails the ability to detect patterns, reason deductively and
think logically. This intelligence is most often associated with scientific and
mathematical thinking. Potential careers: accountant, computer programmer, engineer, scientist, detective.

Musical intelligence involves skill in the performance, composition, and appreciation of
musical patterns. It encompasses the capacity to recognize and compose musical pitches,
tones, and rhythms. According to Howard Gardner musical intelligence runs in an almost
structural parallel to linguistic intelligence. Potential careers: musician, singer, composer, director.

Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence entails the potential of using one's whole body or parts of
the body to solve problems. It is the ability to use mental abilities to coordinate bodily
movements. Howard Gardner sees mental and physical activity as related. Potential careers: athlete, physical therapist, occupational therapist, mechanic, chef, dancer, actor, construction worker. 

Spatial intelligence involves the potential to recognize and use the patterns of wide
space and more confined areas. Potential careers: artist, architect, inventor, bus driver.

Interpersonal intelligence is concerned with the capacity to understand the intentions,
motivations and desires of other people. It allows people to work effectively with others.
Educators, salespeople, religious and political leaders and counselors all need a welldeveloped interpersonal intelligence. Potential careers: counselor, teacher, sales person, politician, management. 

Intrapersonal intelligence entails the capacity to understand oneself, to appreciate one's
feelings, fears and motivations. In Howard Gardner's view it involves having an effective
working model of ourselves, and to be able to use such information to regulate our lives. Potential careers: writer, counselor.

What is the Theory of Multiple Intelligences?

The theory of multiple intelligences was developed in 1983 by Howard Gardener. Instead of a single Full Scale IQ score that conventional intelligence tests produce which can have a fairly narrow and specific focus, Gardener proposed that there are seven different areas that a person can be intelligent in and everyone is a different balance of these. He has since added two additional areas, Naturalistic and Existential. All nine of these areas can also interact with each other as well, as learning does not occur in isolation. This quiz will only focus on the original seven areas.

Disclaimer/decsription on results page:

This is an informal survey of multiple intelligences. Since it is not standardized your scores are only in comparison to yourself. It is interpreted by looking at relative highs and lows rather then exact numbers. Everyone is a different balance of these strengths and weakness.
